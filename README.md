# Cosy Farm Game [[unnamed]]

This is a repository containing my *work* on my cosy farm game.

It is made using **Godot**.

Bear in mind that this is the first game I am making using the engine, so this serves mostly as a way to learn for me and try to continue working on something.

I will try to continuously provide screenshots of the current status to make it more interesting!
